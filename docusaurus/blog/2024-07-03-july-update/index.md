## Dogfooding Redwood

As a final step before Redwood's next major update, we're putting Redwood through its paces by making a racing game as part of a gamejam. We're ironing out a few kinks as we go through the whole process of releasing a vertical slice. Most of our findings have been related to making the developer experience better with using the UE plugin.

## Steam Authentication

Steam's the most popular PC distribution platform, so it might feel silly requiring a username/password if you're shipping your game directly to Steam. In the next release you'll be able to allow one or more authentication providers (username/password and Steam will be the only options for now, but we have more [planned](/docs/support/roadmap#authentication)). This streamlines the onboarding process for your players by creating an account by just launching the game through Steam.

## Looking Ahead

Not much has changed from last month. We're still trying to wrap up this update and re-release the Shooter Template. This is a busy month for us, so hopefully the next development update should have some progress!
