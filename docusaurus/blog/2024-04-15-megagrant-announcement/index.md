We’re excited to announce that [Redwood](https://redwoodmmo.com) recently received an [Epic MegaGrant](https://www.unrealengine.com/megagrants)! This support from Epic Games will accelerate development of Redwood’s most requested features including gameplay templates with player counts of 100s-1000s per server and out-of-the-box support for seamless travel between persistent and instanced servers. With the MegaGrant, we’re excited to move one step closer to realizing our vision to make scalable multiplayer games more accessible.

If you’re not familiar, Redwood is a framework built on top of Unreal Engine 5 that expedites multiplayer development by elevating studios with prebuilt, flexible infrastructure. Redwood leverages gold standard SaaS principles along with MMO infrastructure to make it easy for you to ship a multiplayer game of any size while allowing you to customize every aspect as your needs scale with your development. It’s easy to get started with Redwood using one of our ready-to-launch [gameplay templates](https://redwoodmmo.com/gameplay-templates) or by following the guide on how to quickly [integrate Redwood into your existing project](/docs/miscellaneous/integrating-redwood).
