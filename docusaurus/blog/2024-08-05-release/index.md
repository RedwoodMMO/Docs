It's finally here! Our next major release has landed, and it comes with a ton of updates:

- Lobbies
- Multiple realms
- Sharding (a.k.a. zones & instances)
- Idem matchmaking
- Steam Authentication
- Updated Shooter Template (now called the Match Template)
- Easier & more robust deployment tooling
- Improved backend/game updating process
- HCP Vault for configuration secrets
- Improved Redwood Installer (which downloads the prebuilt UE with Redwood support)

We're still generating missing documentation for the new features, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!

**Note:** You will need to install the latest Redwood Installer version from the License Dashboard to download this new release.

We've addressed most of these in prior development updates, but they're now ready for you to use them! Read more about them in [our prior posts](/blog).

## Looking Ahead

We're relaunching our Match Template demo this week, so be on the lookout for another update about that and some exciting news about the Match Template. The rest of the month we'll be working on Redwood case studies as well as maturing the sharding support.
