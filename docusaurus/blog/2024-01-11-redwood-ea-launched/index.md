We're thrilled to announce that the launch of our MMO framework, Redwood, is finally here! To celebrate the launch, we've made some exciting changes:

- Our new [pricing model](#pricing-model-changes) makes Redwood more economical for smaller studios
- Our [reference documentation](#reference-documentation) is live
- We're offering Redwood [**50% off**](#50-off-discount) during Early Access

## Pricing Model Changes

We're a small studio ourselves, so we understand the need for having indie-friendly pricing. Instead of making official support a required service for all studios, **we're making Premium Support an add-on**.

Those not needing the extra support can save some money, while studios needing 1-day responses from a Redwood developer and a private channel on Slack or Discord can still add Premium Support.

Lastly, we're removing the restriction of purchasing a license for every project. Each studio only needs to **purchase Redwood once and can launch unlimited games** with it.

:::warning
As of October 1, 2024, our pricing model changed again to be a gross revenue royalties. Check our [home page](/#pricing) for the latest info.

## Reference Documentation

We've set our reference documentation live and decided to make it public so everyone can assess Redwood's functionality. All of our documentation, guides, tutorials, tips, and tricks will be posted there for free access. Since we're in Early Access, these docs are still work-in-progress, but be sure that we will continue to expand on them in the coming months.

## 50% off Discount

We fully understand that Redwood isn't finished, and it doesn't yet do everything we have laid out on our [roadmap](https://redwoodmmo.com/docs/support/roadmap). Which is why we're offering Redwood at **half the price during Early Access**.

Purchasing Redwood comes with a year of software updates ($250/year/studio afterwards), and we plan to be out of Early Access before 2025 so you should be able to leverage the cheaper price to get the full framework. We wish we could make guarantees, but we're not going to purposely give empty promises that don't add value for anyone.

## Email Newsletter

If you want to stay up to date with Redwood, but not ready to evaluate it, you can sign up for our newsletter where we'll send out updates on our progress, new features, and other important news. To be as transparent as possible, we'll send an email with ample time before we remove the 50% off discount.
