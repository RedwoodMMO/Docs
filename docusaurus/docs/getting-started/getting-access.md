    :::note
    We have noticed it may take up to 48 hours to get access, but hopefully it should be quick. If you think there's an issue, please [let us know](../support/how-to-get-support.md)!
    :::

1. Once you have access to the [developers page on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/EpicGames/teams/developers), press the **Check Team Membership** button on the Redwood Licenses dashboard as pictured above.

    :::note
    If you ever forget the URL for the License Manager, you can always find a link on the right side of the header of any of these documentation pages.
    :::

1. Once we detect you're part of the GitHub team, the dashboard will show that "Your GitHub account [username] is properly configured".
