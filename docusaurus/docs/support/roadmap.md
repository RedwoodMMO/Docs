# Roadmap

You can find our roadmap on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/RedwoodMMO/projects/1/views/1), here's what each of the columns mean:

- **Backlog**: These are things we plan to get to. Their priority can change frequently, so we haven't put priorities or estimated timelines.
- **Scheduled**: These are a set of tasks that we're planning for the next 1-2 releases; they've been assigned a relative priority that changes as tasks get completed (P0 is the highest, P2 is the lowest).
- **Started but On Hold**: Exactly what it means; we've started that task but it's been benched due to something else being elevated in priority.
- **In Progress**: We're working on these currently.
- **Test / Docs**: We've finished the work, but they still need to be documented and/or tested more.
- **Ready for Release**: These have been completely finished and just waiting for a release to be snapped.
- **Released**: These are now available in the `main` GitHub branches and packaged for Standard Licenses.
