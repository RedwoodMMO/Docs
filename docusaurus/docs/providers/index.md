# Providers

Redwood attempts to abstract the interfaces to various systems and continues to add more providers for each of these systems where applicable. You can also modify the backend to implement your own providers for the supporting systems.

Currently, Redwood supports switching providers for the following systems:
- [Authentication](./authentication/overview.md)
- [Database](./database/overview.md)
- [Redis](./redis/overview.md)
- [Game Server Hosting](./game-server-hosting/overview.md)
- [Ticketing System](./ticketing/overview.md)
- [Transactional Email](./email/overview.md)
