# Queue

The `queue` provider is a simple FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queuing system. It was designed for MMORPGs in mind that may have capacity limits to a limited number of servers. This system will let players into the server based on capacity and/or flow rates (i.e. perhaps the server has 100 free spots but only wants 1 player joining per second).

This provider is still under development, and may not work correctly. Stay tuned for more updates!
