# Instanced Dungeons

An instanced dungeon is simply just another [game profile](../configuration/game-modes-and-maps.md#profiles) that uses [matchmaking](./matchmaking.md). The only big difference between normal match-based games and instanced dungeons what happens to the player when the match is over. In match-based games, the server disconnects the player and they're brought back to the main menu, but in instanced dungeons the server transfers the player to a zone in some overworld proxy.
